# rePatchMe

## About

RPM is a tool to be used for gamigogames' Fiesta Online patcher. 
It allows you to chang eht version of your client, thus letting you
re-patch faulty patches (hence the name).

Other uses include patch history, fixing broken files, and replacing
damaged files (however you managed to "damage" them). Additionally,
this is used as part of my patch analyser, which allows each patch to
be analysed individually.
